# Kickstarter Dataset Analysis.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose: 
I was given Kickstarter dataset that was provided by the client. They want to know how different theater campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals from the Kickstarter dataset in different countries. The client needs to see visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals from 2010 to 2017. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I went through the Kickstarter Dataset excel file that was provided to me by the client. I have identified certain columns with specific data that I will be using in my analysis. There is column D “Goal”, column F “Outcomes”, column Q “Parent category”, column R “Subcategory”, column S “Date Created Conversion”. 
For the first part of project, I have created **a new column U “Year”** in order to extract the year from the “Date Created Conversion” column S.
